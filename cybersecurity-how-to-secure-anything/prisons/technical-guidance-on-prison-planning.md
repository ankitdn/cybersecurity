# Technical Guidance on Prison Planning (UNOps)

- First, establish an understanding of prisoner risk. Create a Prison Profile (elsewhere in document)
- This is how you will determine how much security you need to put in place
- Do NOT just put security measures in place without understanding how much risk we need to mitigate!

## Approaches to physical security

1. Static/physical security -- locks, gates, doors, walls, fences, prisoner-free
areas, watch towers, control/access points, search equipment, CCTV, etc

2. Procedural security -- searching prisoners, escorting vehicles, maintaining prison records, categorizing prisoners,
gathering intelligence about prisoners, etc.

3. Dynamic security -- prison staff building trusting relationships with prisoners

## Types of sally ports

Sally ports are controllable doors used to control access between different areas of a prison.

1. Search

> Prisoners either entering or leaving a building may need to be searched in an adjoining room. A member of prison
staff may position themselves in the foyer to prevent prisoners from passing through the area without a search.
