# Jail Design Guide - Notes

## Chapter 8: Security Perimeter

- Goal: prevent escape and contraband passage

### Ingredients of Security

- Denial (aka prevention): Restrict inmate access to unauthorized internal areas or the outside; provide physical separation for various inmate classifications; control inmate movement using sallyports, staff supervision; eliminate contraband passage with a secure perimeter
- Detection: regular inmate counts, random cell counts, searches, guard notices inmate climbing wall, etc
- Response: triggering lights, lighting selected area, closing gates, etc
- Assessment: determining the nature, degree of a situation

### Design focus
- Creating an overall, 3d barrier called a security perimeter
    - Prevents contraband from coming in
    - Prevents unauthorized people from coming in or leaving
    - This is 3d. Inside is our "security envelope".
- Internal security zones
    - Control internal movement
    - Maintain separation between key activities, inmate occupied areas, especially inmates who pose the highest risk
- Master control (see ch 13)
    - Be able to monitor all security systems (cctv, alarms, motion detectors, etc)
    - Communicate with, control and monitor, and observe people at all egress/ingress points in the main security envelope
    - Communicate with, control and monitor, and observe people at internal security zones. And be able to inhibit their movement
    - Communicate with facility staff, wherever they are in the facility
    - Control entry into the master control space
    - Facilitate efficient staff and inmate movement throughout the facility
